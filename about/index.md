I am Saurav Kumar Dubey, a second year undergraduate in Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Information Technology Nagpur. I am broadly interested in Machine Learning, Big Data Analytics, Predictive Analysis and their applications. I love exploring and learning about new interesting things. I'm also extremely interested in solving puzzles and algorithmic challenges, which guided me to the world of competitive programming.
