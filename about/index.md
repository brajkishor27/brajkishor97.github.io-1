About me <br>
I am Braj Kishor, a third year undergraduate in Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Information Technology Nagpur. I hail from Begusarai, Bihar (BR). I am broadly interested in Cloud Computing, Data Analytics, Middle Ware SOA, Machine Learning, Predictive Analysis and their applications. I love exploring and learning about new technology and science. I'm also extremely interested in solving puzzles and algorithmic challenges, which guided me to the world of competitive programming.<br>
Apart from Academics, I like to play badminton and cook. For more details on the academic front, have a look at my resume.
